# Password Generator
Overview
This project is a Python-based password generator that allows users to create strong, customized passwords by specifying the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in the password.

Features
Easy Mode: The generated password maintains a sequence where letters, symbols, and numbers appear in the order specified by the user.
Hard Mode: The generated password has a random order of letters, symbols, and numbers, making it even more secure.
How It Works
When you run the program, it will prompt you with the following questions:

How many letters would you like in your password?
How many symbols would you like?
How many numbers would you like?
Example Outputs
Easy Mode:
If the user inputs:

4 letters
2 symbols
3 numbers
The password might look like this: fgdx$*924

All the letters are grouped together, followed by symbols and then numbers.

Hard Mode:
The password is randomized in terms of letter, symbol, and number placement. For the same inputs, the password might look like this: x$d24g*f9

Every time a password is generated, the order of characters will be different, providing enhanced security.
